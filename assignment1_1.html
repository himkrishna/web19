        <p> The <u> HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a
            non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS</u>.</p>

            <h1>select tag</h1>
            <p>Each <option> element should have a value attribute containing the data value to submit to the server when that option
                is selected. If no value attribute is included, the value defaults to the text contained inside the element. You can
                include a selected attribute on an
            <option> element to make it selected by default when the page first loads.</p>
